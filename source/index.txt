MongoDB Connector for BI
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

About the |bi|
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-bi-enterprise.rst

The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows users to
create queries with |sql| and visualize, graph, and report on their
MongoDB Enterprise data using existing relational business intelligence
tools such as :doc:`Tableau </connect/tableau>`,
:doc:`MicroStrategy </connect/microstrategy>`, and
:doc:`Qlik </connect/qlik>`.

.. note::

   As an alternative to using third-party data visualization tools and
   the |bi-short|, you can use :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` to create
   data visualizations directly from your MongoDB collections.

The |bi| acts as a layer that translates queries and data between a
|mongod| or |mongos| instance and your reporting tool. The |bi-short|
stores no data, and purely serves to bridge your MongoDB cluster with
business intelligence tools.

System Components 
-----------------

A complete BI system includes the following components:

MongoDB database
  Data storage.

BI Connector
  Provides a relational schema and translates |sql|
  queries between your BI tool and MongoDB.

ODBC data source name (DSN)
  Holds authentication and connection configuration data.

BI Tool Data visualization and analysis.

Most BI tools can import data from a
:doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`. Configure a |dsn| to
point to your |bi-short| instance. This provides you a wide range of
BI tools and |sql| clients with a single data source configuration.

Your BI tool and your |dsn| always run on your local desktop, but your
database and your |bi-short| instance may be local, on premises, or
hosted. The following sections describe possible configurations for a
BI system.

Hosted Database and |bi-short|
------------------------------

.. note::

   If you donâ€™t want to install and manage the |bi-short|, you can use
   {+atlas+}, our fully-managed database-as-a-service. Databases hosted
   on {+atlas+} natively support the |bi| and make it easy to start
   analyzing your data with your preferred BI tools. To get started,
   :website:`create an {+atlas+} cluster </cloud/atlas/lp/general>`.

In this scenario, the database and |bi-short| applications both run on
{+atlas+}, and you set up your :doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`
with connection information that {+atlas+} provides.

Hosted Database and On Premises |bi-short|
------------------------------------------

If you have an {+atlas+} deployment smaller than M10 (including the
{+atlas+} :atlas:`free tier </getting-started/>`), or if your MongoDB
instance is not hosted on {+atlas+}, you can run |bi-short| locally and
specify a remote database address with the
:option:`--mongo-uri <mongosqld --mongo-uri>` option when you start
the BI Connector's :doc:`mongosqld process </reference/mongosqld>`.

On Premises Database and |bi-short|
-----------------------------------

Your organization may have installations of both MongoDB and |bi-short|
elsewhere on your network, in which case you can set up your
:doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>` to point to the |bi-short|
server address.

Local Database and |bi-short|
-----------------------------

For testing and all-in-one-box local experimentation, you can run
MongoDB and |bi-short| on your desktop. This is the simplest
configuration, perfect for quickly looking over the possibilities for
data visualization with |bi-short|.

in the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </local-quickstart>`.
